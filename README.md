Symmetry Breaking is an original performance installation within the building of Farkas Hall. Its performances will mark the culmination of a creative thesis for a joint Physics and Math concentration. It explores the concept of the Higgs boson, the celebrated newly-discovered particle, using a variety of perspectives characterized by a fusion of performing, visual and digital arts. Audience members will have the freedom to explore the space as they choose, stitching together a unique narrative from scenes they encounter. Touching upon the nature of scientific inquiry, the creative process and its destructive capacity, our fascination with origins, poetry, the limitations of communication and more through the lenses of dance, illustration, music, technology, and performance, the installation aims to create a comfortable space in which we can engage with physics and art together in new ways.

For this performance, I developed programs to interface with Microsoft Kinect Sensors. I developed graphics programs in quartz composers that use Kinects to project different visuals on, around, or in response to dancers.
